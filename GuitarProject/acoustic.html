            <h2>  History </h2>

            <p>  
                The guitar is an ancient and noble instrument, whose history can be traced back over <b>4000 years</b>. 
                Many theories have been advanced about the instrument's ancestry, but the modern acoustic guitar comes from a long evolution of stringed musical instruments. 
                It has often been claimed that the guitar is a development of the medieval instrument <i><b>Vihuela</b></i> as evolution of ancient 
                <i><b>Lute</b></i>. (see <i>"Renaissance string instruments"</i> in <a href="./classical.html" target="_blank"><i>Classical page</i></a> )
            </p>

            <p>
                <b><i>Gitterns</i></b>, a small plucked guitar were the first small guitar-like instruments created during the spanish Middle Ages with a round back like that of a lute.
                Modern guitar shaped instruments were not seen until the <b><i>Renaissance</i></b> era where the body and size began to take a guitar-like shape.
            </p>

            <p>
                The earliest string instruments that related to the guitar and its structure where broadly known as the <b>vihuelas</b> within Spanish musical culture. 
                Vihuelas were string instruments that were commonly seen in the 16th century during the Renaissance. 
                Later, Spanish writers distinguished these instruments into two categories of vihuelas. 
                The <b><i>vihuela de arco</i></b> was an instrument that mimicked the <i>violin</i>, and the <b><i>vihuela de penola</i></b> was played with a <b>plectrum</b> (commonly known as a <i>pick</i>) or by hand. 
                When it was played by hand it was known as the <b><i>vihuela de mano</i></b>. 
                Vihuela de mano shared extreme similarities with the Renaissance guitar as it used hand movement at the sound hole or sound chamber of the instrument to create music.
            </p>

            <p>
                By 1790 only six-course vihuela guitars (six <b><i>unison-tuned pairs of strings</i></b>) were being created and had become the main type and model of guitar used in Spain. 
                Most of the older 5-course guitars were still in use but were also being modified to a six-coursed acoustical guitar. 
                <br>
                Fernando Ferandiere's book <b><i>Arte de tocar la guitarra espanola por musica</i></b> (Madrid, 1799) describes the <b>standard Spanish guitar</b> from his time as an <b>instrument with seventeen frets and six courses with the first two 'gut' strings tuned in unison called the terceras and the tuning named to 'G' of the two strings</b>. 
                <br>
                The acoustic guitar at this time began to take the shape familiar in the modern acoustic guitar. 
                The coursed pairs of strings eventually became less common in favor of single strings
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, circa 1850, the form and structure of the modern Guitar is credited to Spanish guitar maker <b>Antonio Torres Jurado</b>, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its proportions, and invented the breakthrough <b>fan-braced pattern</b>. 
                Bracing, which refers to the <b>internal pattern of wood reinforcements</b> used to secure the guitar's top and back and prevent the instrument from collapsing under tension, is an important factor in how the guitar sounds. 
                Torres' design greatly improved the volume, tone, and projection of the instrument, and it has remained essentially <b>unchanged since</b>.

                <h3><i>Acoustic Properties</i></h3>

                <figure class="guitarFig acousticFig">

                    <figcaption><i>Basic anatomy of an acoustic guitar</i></figcaption>
                    <img class="guitarImg acousticImg" src="acousticBodyImg.jpg">
                        
                </figure>

                <p>
                    The acoustic guitar's <b>soundboard</b>, or top, also has a strong effect on the loudness of the guitar. 
                    <b>Woods</b> that actually are good at transmitting sound, like spruce, are commonly used for the soundboard.
                    <br>
                    No amplification actually occurs in this process, because musician add no external energy to increase the loudness of the sound (as would be the case with an <i>electronic amplifier</i>). 
                    All the energy is provided by the plucking of the string. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Without a soundboard, however, the string would just "cut" through the air without actually moving it much. 
                    The soundboard increases the surface of the vibrating area in a process called mechanical impedance matching. The soundboard can move the air much more easily than the string alone, because it is large and flat. 
                    This increases the entire system's energy transfer efficiency, and musicians emit a much louder sound.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In addition, the acoustic guitar has a <b>hollow body</b>, and an additional coupling and resonance effect increases the efficiency of energy transmission in lower frequencies. 
                    The air in a guitar's cavity resonates with the vibrational modes of the string and soundboard. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At low frequencies, which depend on the size of the box, the chamber acts like a <b>Helmholtz resonator</b>, increasing or decreasing the volume of the sound again depending on whether the air in the box moves in phase or out of phase with the strings. 
                    When in phase, the sound increases by about 3 decibels. In opposing phase, it decreases about 3 decibels.

                <h3><i>Amplification</i></h3>

                <p>
                    An acoustic guitar <b>can be amplified</b> by using various types of pickups or microphones. 
                    However, amplification of acoustic guitars had many problems with audio <b>feedback</b>. 
                    <br>
                    In the 1960s, <b><i>Ovation</i></b>'s parabolic bowls dramatically reduced feedback, allowing greater amplification of acoustic guitars.
                    <br>
                    In the 1970s, Ovation developed <i>thinner sound-boards with carbon-based composites</i> laminating a thin layer of birch, in its <b><i>Adamas</i></b> model, which has been viewed as one of the <b>most radical designs in the history of acoustic guitars</b>. 
                    <br>
                    The <i>Adamas</i> model dissipated the sound-hole of the traditional soundboard among 22 small sound-holes in the upper chamber of the guitar, yielding greater volume and further reducing feedback during amplification.
                    <br>
                    Another method for reducing feedback is to fit a rubber or plastic disc into the sound hole.
                    <br>
