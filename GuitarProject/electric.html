                    Many experiments at electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string instrument were made dating back to the early part of the 20th century. 
                    Patents from the <i>1910s</i> show <b>telephone</b> transmitters were adapted and placed inside <b>violins</b> and <b>banjos</b> to amplify the sound. 
                    Hobbyists in the 1920s used <b>carbon button microphones</b> attached to the bridge; however, these detected vibration from the bridge on top of the instrument, resulting in a weak signal. 
                    With numerous people experimenting with electrical instruments in the 1920s and early 1930s, there are many claimants to have been the first to invent an electric guitar.

                    By early-mid 1935, <i>Electro String Instrument Corporation</i> had achieved mainstream success with the <b>A-22 "Frying Pan" steel guitar</b>, 
                    and set out to capture a new audience through its release of the <b>Electro-Spanish Model B</b> and the <b>Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts</b> which was the first full 25" scale electric guitar ever produced.
                    <br>
                    The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was revolutionary for its time, providing players a full 25" scale, with <b>17 frets</b> free of the fretboard.
                    Unlike other lap-steel electrified instruments produced during the time, the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts was designed to play <i>standing vertical, upright with a strap</i>.

                <p> <br> The demand for amplified guitars began during the big band era; as orchestras increased in size, guitar players soon realized the necessity in guitar amplification & electrification. <br></p>

                <h3>Solid Body Guitars</h3>

                <p>
                    The <i>solid-body electric guitar</i> is made of solid wood, without functionally resonating air spaces. 
                    The first solid-body Spanish standard guitar was offered by <i>Vivi-Tone</i> no later than 1934. 
                    This model featured a guitar-shaped body of a single sheet of plywood affixed to a wood frame. 
                    Another early, substantially solid Spanish electric guitar, called the <b>Electro Spanish</b>, was marketed by the Rickenbacker guitar company in 1935 and made of Bakelite. 
                    By 1936, the Slingerland company introduced a wooden solid-body electric model, the Slingerland Songster 401 (and a lap steel counterpart, the Songster 400).

                    <b><i>Gibson</i></b>'s first production electric guitar, marketed in 1936, was the <b>ES-150</b> model ("ES" for "Electric Spanish", and "150" reflecting the $150 price of the instrument, along with matching amplifier). 
                    The ES-150 guitar featured a single-coil, hexagonally shaped "bar" pickup, which was designed by <i>Walt Fuller</i>. It became known as the <i>"Charlie Christian"</i> pickup (named for the great jazz guitarist who was among the first to perform with the ES-150 guitar). 
                    The ES-150 achieved some popularity but suffered from unequal loudness across the six strings.

                <p>
                    A functionally solid-body electric guitar was designed and built in 1940 by <i>Les Paul</i> from an Epiphone acoustic archtop.

                    <i>Lester William Polsfuss</i> (June 9, 1915 – August 12, 2009), known as <i>Les Paul</i>, was an American jazz, country, and blues guitarist, songwriter, luthier, and inventor. 
                    He was one of the pioneers of the solid-body electric guitar. 
                    Paul taught himself how to play guitar, and while he is mainly known for jazz and popular music, he had an early career in country music. He is credited with many recording innovations. 
                    Although he was not the first to use the technique, his early experiments with overdubbing (also known as sound on sound), delay effects such as tape delay, phasing effects and multitrack recording were among the first to attract widespread attention.

                <h3> <i>Blues</i> </h3>
                <p>
                    <i>Blues</i> is a music genre and musical form originated by African Americans in the Deep South of the United States around the end of the 19th century. 
                    The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs, and spirituals.
                    <br>
                    The <b>blues form</b>, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common. 
                    <br>
                    <b>Blue notes</b> (or <i>"worried notes"</i>), usually thirds or fifths flattened in pitch, are also an essential part of the sound. 
                    Blues shuffles or walking bass reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the <b><i>groove</i></b>.

                <p>
                    <i>Jazz</i> is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in <i>blues</i> and <i>ragtime</i>.
                    <br>
                    Jazz is seen by many as "America's classical music".
                    <br>
                    Since the <i>1920s Jazz Age</i>, jazz has become recognized as a <b>major form of musical expression</b>.
                    <br>
                    Jazz is characterized by <b>swing and blue notes</b>, <b>call and response vocals</b>, <b>polyrhythms</b> and <b>improvisation</b>.

                <h3><i>Rock</i></h3>

                <p>
                    <i>Rock</i> music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as <i>"rock and roll"</i> in the United States in the early 1950s.
                    <br>
                    It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s <b>rock and roll</b>, a style which drew heavily on the African-American genres of <b>blues</b> and <b>rhythm and blues</b>, and from <b>country</b> music.
                    <br>
                    Typically, <i>rock</i> is song-based music usually with a <i>4/4</i> time signature using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse.
                    <br>
                    By the late 1960s "classic rock"[1] period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like <i>blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock</i> and many others kept emerging to this day.

                <p>
                        <i>Heavy metal</i> (or simply <i>metal</i>) is a genre of <i>rock music</i> that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom.
                        <br>
                        With roots in <i>blues rock, psychedelic rock, and acid rock</i>, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by <b>highly amplified distortion</b>, <b>extended guitar solos</b>, <b>emphatic beats</b>, and <b>overall loudness</b>. 
                        <br>
                        The genre's lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo.

                    The <b>nut (1.4)</b>—a thin fret-like strip of metal, plastic, graphite or bone—supports the strings at the headstock end of the instrument. 
                    The <b>frets (2.3)</b> are thin metal strips that stop the string at the correct pitch when the player pushes a string against the fingerboard. 
                    The <b>truss rod (1.2)</b> is a metal rod (usually adjustable) that counters the tension of the strings to keep the neck straight. 
                    <b>Position markers (2.2)</b> provide the player with a reference to the playing position on the fingerboard.

                    <br>
                    The <b>neck</b> and <b>fretboard (2.1)</b> extend from the body. 
                    At the <b>neck joint (2.4)</b>, the neck is either glued or bolted to the body. 
                    The <b>body (3)</b> is typically made of wood with a hard, polymerized finish. 
                    Strings vibrating in the magnetic field of the <b>pickups (3.1, 3.2)</b> produce an electric current in the pickup winding that passes through the <b>tone and volume controls (3.8)</b> to the output jack. 
                    Some guitars have piezo pickups, in addition to or instead of magnetic pickups.
                    Some guitars have a <b>fixed bridge (3.4)</b>. 
                    Others have a spring-loaded hinged bridge called a vibrato bar, tremolo bar, or <b>whammy bar</b>, which lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a vibrato embellishment. 
                    A plastic pickguard on some guitars protects the body from scratches or covers the control cavity, which holds most of the wiring.

                    The degree to which the choice of woods and other materials in the solid-guitar body (3) affects the sonic character of the amplified signal is disputed. Many believe it is highly significant, while others think the difference between woods is subtle. In acoustic and archtop guitars, wood choices more clearly affect tone.

                    The solid-body electric guitar does not produce enough sound for an audience to hear it in a performance setting unless it's electronically amplified—plugged into an amplifier, mixing console, or PA.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Guitar amplifier design uses a different approach than sound reinforcement system power amplifiers and home "hi-fi" stereo systems. 
                    Audio amplifiers generally are intended to accurately reproduce the source signal without adding unwanted tonal coloration (i.e., they have a <i>flat frequency response</i>) or unwanted distortion. In contrast, most guitar amplifiers provide tonal coloration and overdrive or distortion of various types.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Guitarists in some musical genres (e.g., <i>blues, rock</i>) <b>intentionally</b> choose amplifiers or effects units that distort or otherwise alter the sound to some degree. 
                    This was not actually a new development in the musical instrument or its supporting gear, but rather a shift of <i>aesthetics</i>, such sounds not having been thought desirable previously.
                    <br>
                    In the <i>1970s</i>, as effects pedals proliferated, their sounds were combined with tube amp distortion at lower, more controlled volumes by using power attenuators, such as <b>Tom Scholz</b>'s Power Soak, as well as re-amplified dummy loads, such as <b>Eddie Van Halen</b>'s use of dummy-load power resistor, post-power-tube effects, and a final solid-state amp driving the guitar speakers.

                    Among the first actual on-board effects were a tremolo system, or a mechanical spring reverb unit. In the 2010s, guitar amps often contain multiple effects, such as distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser, or octave shift.

                    In the <i>1960s</i>, the tonal palette of the electric guitar was further modified by introducing <b>effect units</b> in its signal path, before the guitar amp, of which one of the earliest units was the <i>fuzz pedal</i>. 
                    <br>
                    Effects units come in several formats, the most common of which are the stompbox "pedal" and the rackmount unit. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A <b>stomp box</b> (or <b>pedal</b>) is a small metal or plastic box containing the circuitry, which is placed on the floor in front of the musician and connected in line with the patch cord connected to the instrument. 
                    <br>
                    The box is typically controlled by one or more foot-pedal on-off switches and it typically contains only one or two effects. 
                    Pedals are smaller than rackmount effects and usually less expensive. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <i>"Guitar pedalboards"</i> are used by musicians who use multiple stomp-boxes; these may be a DIY project made with plywood or a commercial stock or custom-made pedalboard.

                    <ul>
                        Typical effects include:
                        <li><i>Effects such as <b>stereo chorus</b>, <b>phasers</b> and <b>flangers</b>, which shift the pitch of the signal by a small and varying amount, creating swirling, shimmering and whooshing noises</i></li>
                        <li><i>Effects such as <b>octavers</b>, which displace pitch by an exact musical interval</i></li>
                        <li><i><b>Distortion</b>, such as transistor-style fuzz, effects incorporating, emulating vacuum tube distortion or overdrive</i></li>
                        <li><i>Filters, such as <b>wah-wah</b></i></li>
                        <li><i>Envelope shapers, such as <b>compression/sustain</b> or <b>volume/swell</b></i></li>
                        <li><i>Time-shift effects, such as <b>delay</b> and <b>reverb</b></i></li>
                    </ul>
