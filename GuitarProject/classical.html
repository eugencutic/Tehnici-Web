                    While the precise lineage of the instrument is still unclear, historians believe that the guitar is the descendant of the <i>Greek kithara, gittern, lyre, European and Middle Eastern lutes, and the Spanish vihuela</i>. 
                    The poem <i>The Book of Good Love</i> [circa 1330] describes two early instruments, <i>guitarra morisca</i> and <i>guitarra latina</i>.

                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i><q>Then came out, with a strident sound, the two-stringed Moor’s gittern,<br>
                    High-pitched as to its range, as to its tone both harsh and bold;<br>
                    Big-bellied lute which marks the time for merry, rustic dance,<br>
                    And Spanish guitar which with the rest was herded in the fold</q></i>

                    Instruments called <i>"guitars"</i> were first mentioned in literature in the 13th century, though many of these medieval records describe instruments that in modern times are classified as <i>gitterns</i>.
                </p>

                

                <p>
                    

                    The first incarnation of what is now called the <i>guitar</i> first appeared during the <b><i>Renaissance</i></b>. <br>
                    The Renaissance guitar contained four pairs of strings called courses. <br>
                    The Renaissance guitar shared most similarities with the Spanish vihuela, a six-coursed instrument with similar tuning and construction.

                </p>

                    <b>Juan Bermudo</b> in 1555 published <i>Declaración de Instrumentos Musicales</i>, a treatise containing a section on plucked string instruments. 
                    This publication examined the relationship between the guitar and vihuela, and also differentiated between four- and five-course guitars. 
                    The five-course guitar did not phase out the four-course instrument until the <b><i>Baroque</i></b> period.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The <i>vihuela</i> became popular in <i><b>Spain</b></i> and <b><i>Italy</i></b> and remained common until the late <i>16th century</i>. 
                    This instrument appears to have had a strong influence in the design and tuning of the early five-course guitars that first appeared in Spain in the middle of the sixteenth century. 
                    These five-course guitarras replaced the four-course Renaissance instruments, particularly in Spain. 
                    The <b><i>guitarra</i></b> set the modern standard tuning – <b>A, D, G, B, E</b> – for the top five strings that <i><b>continues to this day</b></i>.
                    The number of <b>frets</b> on the guitar was increased from <b>eight</b> to <b>ten</b> and eventually to <b>twelve</b>. 
                    Later, it was in <b>Italy</b> that a <b>sixth course</b> became commonplace and this was an easily done by replacing or reworking the nut and bridge to plug in another tuning peg hole for the sixth string.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    From the <i>mid-18th century through the early 19th century</i>, the guitar evolved into a <b>six-string instrument</b>, phasing out courses by preference to single strings. 
                    These six-string guitars were still smaller than the modern classical guitar.

                    The design of the <b><i>modern classical guitar</i></b> can be attributed to <b><i>Antonio de Torres</i></b>. 
                    The construction of these guitars has been considered the standard in "traditional" instruments since the mid 19th century.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Contemporary classical guitars</b> follow the Smallman design which replaces the fan braces with a much lighter balsa brace attached to the back of the sound board with carbon fiber. 
                    The balsa brace has a honeycomb pattern and allows the (now much thinner) sound board to support more vibrational modes. 
                    This leads to <b>greater volume</b> and <b>longer sustain</b>.

                <p>
                    At the beginning of the 1920s, Andrés Segovia popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings. 
                    Segovia collaborated with the composers Federico Moreno Torroba and Joaquin Turina with the aim of extending the guitar repertoire with new music.
                    Segovia's tour of South America revitalized public interest in the guitar and helped the guitar music of Manuel Ponce and Heitor Villa-Lobos reach a wider audience.
                    The composers Alexandre Tansman and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco were commissioned by Segovia to write new pieces for the guitar.
                    Luiz Bonfá popularized Brazilian musical styles such as the newly created Bossa Nova, which was well received by audiences in the USA.

                    <h3><i>Details</i></h3>

                    <h4><b>Fretboard</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        The fretboard is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck.
                        <br>
                        Fretboards are most commonly made of ebony, but may also be made of rosewood or of phenolic composite ("micarta").
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Frets</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        Frets are the metal strips embedded along the fingerboard and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically. 
                        <br>
                        The strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets. 
                        <br>
                        Each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale.
                        <br>
                        The ratio of the widths of two consecutive frets is the twelfth root of two, whose numeric value is about 1.059463.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Body</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of spruce, red cedar, redwood or mahogany. 
                        <br>
                        This thin (often 2 or 3 mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the <i>most prominent factor in determining the <b>sound quality</b> of a guitar</i>. 
                        <br>
                        The majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it.
                        The body of a classical guitar is a <i>resonating chamber</i> that projects the vibrations of the body through a <i>sound hole</i>, allowing the guitar to be heard without amplification. 
                        The <i>sound hole</i> is normally a single round hole in the top of the guitar (under the strings), though some have different placement, shapes, or numbers of holes. 
                        How much air an instrument can move determines its maximum volume.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Bridge</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        The main purpose of the <i>bridge</i> on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the <i>soundboard</i>, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the <i>strings</i>. 
                        <br>
                        The bridge holds the strings in place on the body. 
                        <br>
                        Also, the position of the saddle, usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge, determines the distance to the nut (at the top of the fingerboard).
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Size</b></h4>

                    <p>
                            The modern full size classical guitar has a scale length of around <i>650 mm (26 in)</i>, with an overall instrument length of <i>965–1,016 mm (38.0–40.0 in)</i>. 
                            <br>
                            The scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument, <i>Antonio de Torres</i>. 
                            <br>
                            This length may have been chosen because it's <b>twice the length of a violin string</b>.

                            <b>Smaller-scale instruments</b> are produced to <b>assist children</b> in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together, making it easier for smaller hands.
                            Full-size instruments are sometimes referred to as <i>4/4</i>, while the smaller sizes are <i>3/4, 1/2 or 1/4</i>.
