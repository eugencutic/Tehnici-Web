                <p>
                    The acoustic guitar's <b>soundboard</b>, or top, also has a strong effect on the loudness of the guitar. 
                    <b>Woods</b> that actually are good at transmitting sound, like spruce, are commonly used for the soundboard.
                    <br>
                    No amplification actually occurs in this process, because musician add no external energy to increase the loudness of the sound (as would be the case with an <i>electronic amplifier</i>). 
                    All the energy is provided by the plucking of the string. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Without a soundboard, however, the string would just "cut" through the air without actually moving it much. 
                    The soundboard increases the surface of the vibrating area in a process called mechanical impedance matching. The soundboard can move the air much more easily than the string alone, because it is large and flat. 
                    This increases the entire system's energy transfer efficiency, and musicians emit a much louder sound.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    In addition, the acoustic guitar has a <b>hollow body</b>, and an additional coupling and resonance effect increases the efficiency of energy transmission in lower frequencies. 
                    The air in a guitar's cavity resonates with the vibrational modes of the string and soundboard. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At low frequencies, which depend on the size of the box, the chamber acts like a <b>Helmholtz resonator</b>, increasing or decreasing the volume of the sound again depending on whether the air in the box moves in phase or out of phase with the strings. 
                    When in phase, the sound increases by about 3 decibels. In opposing phase, it decreases about 3 decibels.

                <p>
                    An acoustic guitar <b>can be amplified</b> by using various types of pickups or microphones. 
                    However, amplification of acoustic guitars had many problems with audio <b>feedback</b>. 
                    <br>
                    In the 1960s, <b><i>Ovation</i></b>'s parabolic bowls dramatically reduced feedback, allowing greater amplification of acoustic guitars.
                    <br>
                    In the 1970s, Ovation developed <i>thinner sound-boards with carbon-based composites</i> laminating a thin layer of birch, in its <b><i>Adamas</i></b> model, which has been viewed as one of the <b>most radical designs in the history of acoustic guitars</b>. 
                    <br>
                    The <i>Adamas</i> model dissipated the sound-hole of the traditional soundboard among 22 small sound-holes in the upper chamber of the guitar, yielding greater volume and further reducing feedback during amplification.
                    <br>
                    Another method for reducing feedback is to fit a rubber or plastic disc into the sound hole.
