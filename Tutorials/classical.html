                    <h3><i>Details</i></h3>

                    <h4><b>Fretboard</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        The fretboard is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck.
                        <br>
                        Fretboards are most commonly made of ebony, but may also be made of rosewood or of phenolic composite ("micarta").
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Frets</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        Frets are the metal strips embedded along the fingerboard and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically. 
                        <br>
                        The strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets. 
                        <br>
                        Each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale.
                        <br>
                        The ratio of the widths of two consecutive frets is the twelfth root of two, whose numeric value is about 1.059463.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Body</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of spruce, red cedar, redwood or mahogany. 
                        <br>
                        This thin (often 2 or 3 mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the <i>most prominent factor in determining the <b>sound quality</b> of a guitar</i>. 
                        <br>
                        The majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it.
                        The body of a classical guitar is a <i>resonating chamber</i> that projects the vibrations of the body through a <i>sound hole</i>, allowing the guitar to be heard without amplification. 
                        The <i>sound hole</i> is normally a single round hole in the top of the guitar (under the strings), though some have different placement, shapes, or numbers of holes. 
                        How much air an instrument can move determines its maximum volume.
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Bridge</b></h4>

                    <p>
                        The main purpose of the <i>bridge</i> on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the <i>soundboard</i>, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the <i>strings</i>. 
                        <br>
                        The bridge holds the strings in place on the body. 
                        <br>
                        Also, the position of the saddle, usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge, determines the distance to the nut (at the top of the fingerboard).
                    </p>

                    <h4><b>Size</b></h4>

                    <p>
                            The modern full size classical guitar has a scale length of around <i>650 mm (26 in)</i>, with an overall instrument length of <i>965–1,016 mm (38.0–40.0 in)</i>. 
                            <br>
                            The scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument, <i>Antonio de Torres</i>. 
                            <br>
                            This length may have been chosen because it's <b>twice the length of a violin string</b>.
                            <br>
                            <b>Smaller-scale instruments</b> are produced to <b>assist children</b> in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together, making it easier for smaller hands.
                            Full-size instruments are sometimes referred to as <i>4/4</i>, while the smaller sizes are <i>3/4, 1/2 or 1/4</i>.
